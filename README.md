# Mobile flashcards app

This aim of this project was to create a simple flashcards app to help studying any given material.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Making it work

Inside the project directory, you should first run
### `npm install` or `yarn install`

After that you can run it with

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

After the startup process has finished, you should see a barcode that has to be scanned with Expo app to see the result.
